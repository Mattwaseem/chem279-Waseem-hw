## 1. How to Run Code and Execute Object Files

To run this code and run the object files, please make sure that you have CMake and a compatible C++ compiler installed. Then following these steps to compile:

1. Go to the project directory.
2. CD to build directory
3. In the command terminal run "cmake .."
4. Then build by running "make"
5. Next go to root directory and input "./bin/ljpotenial"

The executable file in bin directory will run the main source code via the main.cpp file in the soruce directory.<br>
This will print the output for all three problems which includes LJ energies, analytical force, central difference and forward difference <br>
It will also print out the optimized coordinates for lowest energy after the steepest line search optimization.


## 2. Problem 1: Lennard-Jones Potential Energy Function

### 2.1 Objectives of Problem 1:
- To implement the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential energy function in C++ based on the equations provided in lectures.
- Please check for proper file handling, including reading atomic positions from text files and providing appropriate error codes when file handling fails.


### 3. Problem 2: Finite Difference vs Analytical Force

#### 3.1 Objective of Problem 2:
Implement force calculation using the finite difference method and compare it with the analytical force calculation from the LJ potential.

#### 3.2 Subsections:

##### 3.2.1 Using Functions from Problem 1:
Reusing the LJ energy function from Problem 1 to assist in force calculations. This keeps a consistency between energy and force computations.

##### 3.2.2 Calculating Analytical, Forward Difference, and Central Difference Forces:
Implementing both analytical force calculation and numerical differentiation (forward and central differences) to compute the forces between atoms.
A comparison is made between the analytical and finite difference forces to ensure accuracy.

##### 3.2.3 Comparing Truncation Errors:
The truncation error for both the forward and central difference methods is compared. The goal was to observe how step size impacts the accuracy of the finite difference methods. Hoowever, I was having some trouble with this over the weekend.
**Note:** This section I had an issue where the central difference consistently resulted in zero values. Due to time constraints, the error causing this I could not resolve by myself.


### 4. Problem 3: Optimizing the Geometry of Small Gold Cluster

#### 4.1 Objective of Problem 3:
Use line search to optimize the energy and force for a small gold cluster using the steepest descent optimization method with line search.

#### 4.2 Subsections:

##### 4.2.1 Implementing Line Search:
Implementing line search in conjunction with the steepest descent optimization algorithm to minimize the energy of the gold cluster.

##### 4.2.2 Testing the Optimizer:
The optimizer was tested with the provided text files to ensure that it correctly reduced the potential energy of the system.
